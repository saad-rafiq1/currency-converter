This project is a simple web-based currency converter that converts from **USD (United States Dollar)** to various other currencies, including **EUR (Euro)**, **CAD (Canadian Dollar)**, **AUD (Australian Dollar)**, **PKR (Pakistani Rupee)**, and more. The project uses a currency exchange API to fetch the latest exchange rates in real time.

## Features

- Converts from USD to multiple currencies (e.g., EUR, CAD, AUD, PKR, etc.).
- Utilizes real-time exchange rates via an external API.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Easy to extend to support additional currencies if needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Fetch API** for making API requests to the currency exchange API.

## How It Works

1. The user selects the target currency from a dropdown or input.
2. The user inputs the amount in USD.
3. The app fetches the latest exchange rate for the selected currency.
4. The converted amount is displayed based on the current exchange rate.
